After making the game start with ./rlg327
-- commands have been removed as such functionality can be done in game

Added a menu screen with four options:
-Start Game
-Settings
-Replay Last Game
-Quit Game

Start and Quit are self explanatory

Settings
Settings can be choseng using the up and down arrow keys
Can adjust the default monsters from 1 - 50
Can adjust the default objects from 1 -50
To ajust the user can user the left and right key or they can enter in a number
Once settings are set the user must select save settings by hitting the enter key

There are also hidden setting (cheats)
This can be unlocked by typing 'cheats' a confirmation message will show up
Once entered the teleport (g),player fog toggle(f), and auto play(A) are all enabled
The user can continue by typing "health" "speed" or "damage" and hitting enter
A confirmation message will pop up
The user then enters a integer value which will set the corresponding player charateristic
The user stays in the cheat interface until they enter a nonvalid command
To reset the player back to default (without cheats or modified stats) the user can type in disable

Replay Last Game
Allows the user to step through there last game (left and right keys) with a bunch of statistics shown on the bottom
The user can enable auto-play by hitting the 'a' button and can increase speed with '=' or '+' and decrease speed with '-' or '_'
The default speed is suppose to mimic the same speed that the user played the game at
The speed up/slow down value is show in the lower right corner
Hitting the 'a' button again will remove the autoplay
To get back to the main menu the user must hit the esc key and not be in auto mode
This can get somewhat memory intensive. A game with a million moves will take up about 3.5gb of ram.

Most of the new functions are put into the io.cpp file with the notable ones being:
startScreen
playerControls
playerReplay
resetReplay
plus various helper functions

I also added a 2d array of vectors to the dungeon to keep track of the replay as well as an array of vectors to keep track of statistics
Changes were made throughout the game to keep track of such information
